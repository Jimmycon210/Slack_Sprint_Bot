# Slack_Sprint_Bot

# Instructions
Clone this repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/Jimmycon210/Slack_Sprint_Bot.git
```

Once the repo is cloned, run npm install for the dependencies.
Lastly, run npm run start or in VSCode, run the start button in the debugger to have the app up and running.

The app runs on port 3000 so you will need an ngrok.io instance running on that port. You will use that in order to install 
the app into Slack.
